# Introduction section
intro: |
  I am an IT architect with 25+ years experience and passion working in technology. 
  I have primarily had the responsibility of working as an IT infrastructure architect and have also led teams and managed projects.
  I have worked across a broad range of technologies 
  thereon: Cisco, ACI, Juniper, AIX, Linux, Ansible, DC infrastructure, and most recently NEO4J and data science.
  As well as spending a reasonable amount of time building Cloud Network Infrastructure. I am a principal and voting member of the IBM Global Shared Network Inrastructure architecture governance board.
  <br/><br/>
  I have had lead roles in large scale data center migration, management, 
  and governance roles across Europe and globally.
  <br/><br/>
  I have worked in the IT industry since 1995. 
  I started as a specialist for UNIX and networking. 
  I quickly moved on to parallel computing, enterprise firewall design, and automation, as an architect and consultant. 
  Initially working for an IBM business partner I was involved in both large and small projects across a wide spectrum. 
  Activities included planning and providing training to customers, architecture, consulting, delivery of architectures, automation, team lead, and last level support for more complex problems. 
  Notable achievements are over 5 Extranet firewalls for large corporations and SMB aswell as automated HA solutions before 2000.
  <br/><br/>
  In 2000 I left the business partner to start up my own consulting company. 
  During which time I developed and used a documentation system which fully integrated changes made in the customer environment into versioned documents. 
  Other achievments during this time are customer aquisition and numerous small projects such as highly available DHCP infrastructures or Intranet firewalls.
  <br/><br/>
  In late 2000 I decided to start working for IBM in the official job role of an IT Architect.
  I have since used the possibilities I was given to expand my knowledge and my network and to become one of the go to people for 
  infrastucture related questions within IBM globally. 
  I have driven data centre design, network design, security design, Virtualization design, and systems management. 
  Amongst other things I have worked with international teams to further Linux on z, data centre design, firewall design, virtualization, and IDS design. 
  I have lead teams, managed projects and supervised implementations across a wide range of projects and technical platforms as well as taking the occasional deep dive into topics like penetration testing or data analysis.
  </br>
  My wants - </br>
  - work with a young team</br>
  - work in an innovative environment</br>
  - pass experience on </br>
  - simple processes </br>
  - work efficiently and sustainably. </br>

  - title: Cloud platforms
    text: |
      I have primarily used IBM/CMS and IBM/Softlayer. 
      I have experience setting up, configuring and running the network intra- and inter-connectivity and security. 
      From underlay, through LAN and WAN, to overlay.
  - title: Data analysis
    text: |
      Through experience with multiple DC builds, relocations, merges, out and in-sourcing, and closures, I have learned the importance of having good data. 
      In the last few years I have built an extensive set of tools including graph databses and visulaization tools. 
      Examples are cabling analysis graphs, data based 2 and 3d Rack visualisations, Security policy graphs, network analysis graphs, and general data analysis, transformation, integration, import and export tools.
      Including Airflow checking and automated interfaces to vendor DBs.
  - title: IPv6 Planning
    text: |
      In the past years I have been involved in a number of IPv6 projects ranging from simple, Internet connectivity,
      to complex, Enterprise planning reports to the IBM board. 
      I worked as a lead architect in the planning phase for IBM's migration to IPv6. 
      I also worked as an architect for some of the address space planning for the IBM Global Shared Network Infrastructure. 
      In addition I also drove the planning for the IPv6 single and dual stack for the CMS cloud Infrastructure, 
      which was no implemented and instead has flowed into other internal infrastructure architectures.
  - title: Development Control 
    text: |
      I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked primarily with Git and Travis. 
      I have experience with an array of testing tools and CI/CD technologies and methods.
  - title: Internet Of Things (IOT)
    text: |
      I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including MQTT, NEO4J, a selection of micro controllers (esp8266, esp32, arduino), Raspberry Pi, KNX/EIB, LORAWAN, ISM Band communications, and many other related topics.

    title: Enablement and acceleration of live and near-live migration of virtual machines and their associated storage across networks 
    ID: US8429651B2
    link: https://patents.google.com/patent/US8429651B2/en?q=inventor;sean&inventor=donnellan&oq=inventor;sean+donnellan
    abstract: |
      A virtual machine is migrated between a source cloud and a destination cloud. A temporary storage is mounted to a partition management firmware of the source cloud and to a partition management firmware of the destination cloud. A first storage location migration migrates the virtual machine from the source cloud to the at least one temporary storage. A second storage location migration migrates the virtual machine from the at least one temporary storage to final destination storage of the destination cloud. The temporary storage is then unmounted from the partition management firmware of the source cloud and from the partition management firmware of the destination cloud.
  - patent:
    title: Communications between virtual machines that have been migrated 
    ID: US8448171B2
    link: https://patents.google.com/patent/US8448171B2/en?q=inventor;sean&inventor=donnellan&oq=inventor;sean+donnellan
    abstract: |
      A method, apparatus, and computer program product for managing communications between a plurality of applications are presented. A determination is made as to whether an address in a message is a prior address for a second application in the plurality of applications in response to receiving a message from a first application in the plurality of applications. The message is sent onto a virtual network configured to handle prior addresses for the plurality of applications in response to the address in the message being the prior address for the second application being located on another virtual machine from the first application.

    title: Method and apparatus for providing a test network as an IP accessible cloud service
    ID: US9286103B2
    link: https://patents.google.com/patent/US9286103B2/en?q=inventor;sean&inventor=donnellan&oq=inventor;sean+donnellan
    abstract: A method and structure for a cloud service includes an API (application programming interface) as tangibly embodied in a set of computer-executable instructions and selectively executable on a computer on a network. The API provides a user interface for a cloud environment comprising one or more virtual machines to be selectively instantiated on at least one computer in the network upon a user request. A library is accessible via the API, the library providing definitions of components available to be instantiated in the cloud environment. The API automatically instantiates an image of a virtual network of components, as defined by a user input request and provides at least one cloud portal providing the user an access to exercise the instantiated virtual network image.
  - patent:
    title: Deploy a secure customer domain in a virtualized multi-tenant environment 
    ID: DE112014002799T5
    link: https://patents.google.com/patent/DE112014002799T5/en
    abstract:  To provide a secure customer domain in a virtualized multi-tenant environment, a virtual machine (VM) is configured in a customer domain. A first, a second, and a third network interface (VNICs) are configured in the VM. The first VNIC has a first network address in a first address range for a customer domain and allows an application in the VM to access a second application in a second VM in the customer domain. The second VNIC allows a third application outside the customer domain to access the VM in the customer domain. The second VNIC is configured to utilize an address specification used by the server and the third application. The third VNIC allows access from the first application to a fourth application running outside the customer domain. The third VNIC is configured to use an address specification used by the server of the fourth application.
